# Brielle-fullstack-web-Platform

## Overview
A full-stack web application built to demonstrate production-style development: a clean frontend, a structured backend API, and a relational database.

## What Problem This Solves
Many small teams and small businesses struggle to manage users, records, and workflows in one simple system. This project focuses on building a clear, secure, and scalable platform to manage those core operations.

## Key Features (Planned / In Progress)
- User authentication (register/login/logout)
- Role-based access (admin/user) *(optional)*
- Dashboard with key stats *(optional)*
- CRUD management for core entities (e.g., clients, bookings, products, orders—choose based on your theme)
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive UI for mobile and desktop

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(or React — update if you use it)*
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express *(or PHP — update if you use it)*
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
